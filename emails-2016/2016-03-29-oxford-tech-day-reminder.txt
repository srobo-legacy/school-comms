Subject: Student Robotics: Oxford Tech Day Reminder

Hi {first_name},

As the competition nears, we hope that your robot is nearly complete.

In order to help you complete those final few things, and to give you another
chance to test your robot before the big day, there's one tech day left.
It's happening at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratories, Harwell, near Oxford,
on the 9 of April.  Please let us know if you would like to bring your team
along to it.  Details of the event can be found on our website at:

Whether or not you decide to come, we wish you and your robot the best of luck.

Thanks,

The Student Robotics Team
