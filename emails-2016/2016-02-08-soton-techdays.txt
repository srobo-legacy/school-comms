Subject: Student Robotics Tech Days in Southampton

Hi {first_name},

We hope you're team is enjoying building their robot and are looking forward to upcoming competition!

We've got two more tech days happening in Southampton. One on the 27th February ( https://www.studentrobotics.org/events/sr2016/2016-02-27-southampton-tech-day-3 ) and another on the 19th March ( https://www.studentrobotics.org/events/sr2016/2016-03-19-southampton-tech-day-4 ). We encourage anyone to come along, it will be a great opportunity to test out your robot and see how the other teams are getting on. There will also be a test arena available for you to use with tokens and the appropriate carpet.

We look forward to seeing as many of you here as possible. If you are intending on coming to one of our tech days, it would be great if you could notify us in advance, details are available on the event pages or on our contact page ( https://www.studentrobotics.org/about/contactus ).
