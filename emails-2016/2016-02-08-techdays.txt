Subject: Student Robotics Upcoming Tech Days

Hi {first_name},

We hope you're team is enjoying building their robot and are looking forward to upcoming competition!

There are a number of tech days happening over the next few weeks that we wanted to draw your attention to. If you don't know, a tech day is a day hosted at one of our branches where your team will be able to work on their robot with plenty of help from volunteers and the other teams.

We've got two more tech days happening in Southampton. One on the 27th February ( https://www.studentrobotics.org/events/sr2016/2016-02-27-southampton-tech-day-3 ) and another on the 19th March ( https://www.studentrobotics.org/events/sr2016/2016-03-19-southampton-tech-day-4 ). We encourage anyone to come along, it will be a great opportunity to test out your robot and see how the other teams are getting on. There will also be a test arena available for you to use with tokens and the appropriate carpet.

In London, there is a second tech day happening on the 5th March ( https://www.studentrobotics.org/events/sr2016/2016-03-05-london-tech-day-2 ) where you will get a chance to talk to volunteers and work on your robot.

There are also plans for tech days in Bristol, although those dates are not yet finalised, you can keep up-to-date by checking our key dates ( https://www.studentrobotics.org/key_dates ) page on the website.

We look forward to seeing as many of you there as possible. If you are intending on coming to one of our tech days, it would be great if you could notify us in advance, details are available on the event pages or on our contact page ( https://www.studentrobotics.org/about/contactus ).
