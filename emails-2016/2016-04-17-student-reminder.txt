Subject: Student Robotics: Competition reminder

Hi {first_name},

The Student Robotics competition is just two weeks away -- we hope you're
busy testing how your robot operates and preparing for the competition. Just
to remind you, here are a few things you should be bringing to the
competition:

 * Your robot.
 * Any tools you need to modify your robot
 * Your ticket. If you have not returned a media consent form to your team
   leader, please do so ASAP, otherwise you won't get a ticket and may be
   turned away!
 * At least one laptop per team for writing your robot code. We'll be
   providing wireless and one ethernet connection per team. (Please ensure
   you bring a laptop that has the right connector / adapter for a wired
   connection).

Please also bring all the kit you received in the kit box so that it can be
returned at the end of the comeptition. A full list is in an appendix in the 
rulebook [0].

Additionally, your robot MUST pass the safety check procedure in
the rulebook. In particular, your robot must provide protection against the
battery being punctured / crushed if robots collide, such as a battery
compartment or casing. Battery damage is a serious fire risk, and your robot
will not be allowed to compete if it is not safe.

We all hope you enjoy the competition, and may the best robot win!
