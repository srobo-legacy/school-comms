Subject: Student Robotics: Further competition details and kit return

Hi {first_name},

We hope you're in the final stages of planning your teams attendance of the
Student Robotics competition, on the weekend of the 30th of April. Full
details appear on this [0] page, if anything is unclear or absent please don't
hesitate to get in contact with us (via reply or info@). In particular, if
you're no longer planning on taking part, please inform us ASAP.

At the competition, your team will inevitably wish to change their code,
meaning at least one team member will need to bring a laptop / other device
for writing code. We will be unable to provide any computers at the
competition ourselves, sorry. This year we intend on providing both wireless
and wired internet at the competition (one cat-5 ethernet cable per team pit).

We expect all the Student Robotics kit you've been loaned to be returned at
the competition. If you'd like to keep the kit longer, please email
info@studentrobotics.org requesting a loan extension ASAP.

As mentioned in previous emails, the competitors in your team all need to
bring tickets to the competition, which they get by returning a media
consent form. Instructions are in previous emails we've sent: please get these
back to us ASAP, to mediaconsent@studentrobotics.org . If your competitors
turn up without tickets, we may turn them away.

We look forwards to seeing you and the team at the competition, and may the
best robot win!
