Subject: Student Robotics 2015 feedback and registrations for next year

Hi {first_name},

Thank you for taking part in Student Robotics 2015! We hope you enjoyed the
competition -- our volunteers certainly did, and were impressed at the
ingenuity and effort that went into all the robots. We also hope it was a great
experience for the competitors, and that they learnt about engineering and
performing large projects!

If you or the team have any photos of the competition you'd like to share,
we highly recommend using this Flickr group [0] to group them, ideally under
a creative commons license.

There are a few outstanding issues which should be cleared up over the coming
week:
 - If you didn't make it to the competition, we'll be contacting you shortly
   regarding the kit
 - If you arranged to keep the kit after the competition, we'll confirm the
   date we expect it back by, and the shipping arrangements for its return
 - If you claimed the team budget, we'll be mailing you this week to confirm
   the amount and cheque details

Regarding next year's competition, we've now opened registrations [1] for SR2016
and hope to supply another great competition. As with this year, places won't
be confirmed until closer to the Kickstart date in case we're oversubscribed.
The competition game itself will not be revealed until Kickstart either.

Finally, we'd love to hear from you about how we did, what went well and what
didn't, and anything that could be done better. We're aware of a couple of
hiccups with the new power board kit that need polishing, but it's performed
well after such a significant change [2]. One matter we're aware of is that
the structure of A-levels is now quite different to previous years, and it
might be better (for competitors) to move the Kickstart / Competition dates
around. We'd love to hear your opinion on this matter.

To send feedback, please email jmorse@studentrobotics.org, and I'll forward
your message on to our volunteers. Unless you request otherwise, feedback
will be anonymised, so please feel free to speak your mind.

Once more, thank you for taking part and shepherding another year of
competitors through the competition, and we hope to see you at a future
competition.
