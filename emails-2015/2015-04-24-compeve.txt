Subject: Student Robotics: final final notes

Hi {first_name},

We're almost complete setting up here in Newbury and are looking forwards to
seeing you all tomorrow -- here are a final couple of notes about attendance:
 * We will be collecting battery chargers and spare batteries from teams when
   you arrive: all battery charging wil be performed upstairs at 'Helpdesk'.
   Please have your charger and spare battery ready to hand over when you enter
   the building.
 * The venue parking location has been confirmed -- please check the event page
   [0] under the 'parking' heading to see where you're going. The venue will
   have parking marshalls on site in the morning
 * We require all competitors to bring a ticket; if they've forgotten it
   but have already returned a media consent form however, we're still willing
   to let them in. (The consent forms are what we particularly care about)
 * Any visiting adult will be able to sign a media consent form at the door
 * A couple of competitors will be allowed to hand over media consent forms at
   the door to the competition. This only applies if you've arranged it with
   me already.

We look forwards to seeing you tomorrow, and may the best robot win!
