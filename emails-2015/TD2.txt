Subject: Student Robotics: second tech days

Hi {first_name},

We've now confirmed the second set of tech days, at the Universities of
Southampton and Bristol. They'll be held on the 21st of Feb and the 7th
of Feb, respectively. Full details can be found on the event pages:

We're also finalising a tech day near Oxford, at Rutherford Appleton
Laboratories on the 21st of Feb, which we'll be confirming in the next
couple of days. More on that shortly.

A happy new year, and happy robot hacking!
