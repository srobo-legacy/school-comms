Subject: Student Robotics: second tech days

Hi {first_name},

We've now confirmed the second set of tech days, at the Universities of
Southampton and Bristol. They'll be held on the 21st of Feb and the 7th
of Feb, respectively. Full details can be found on the event pages:

We're currently finalizing details for the competition venue and date
(taking longer than expected this year, sorry). The competition is
highly likely to be on the 18th and 19th of April, the end of the uni
Easter holidays, which is when we've always run it in the past. We can't
guarantee that right at this moment, though.

A happy new year, and happy robot hacking!
